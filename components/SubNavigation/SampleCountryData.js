World Vision warns that children will pay the price as they face a greater risk of violence, abuse and exploitation\n</p><p> As an International Partnership, World Vision Canada (WVC) is still operational in Afghanistan and working to meet the needs of children and their families. WVC has worked in Afghanistan but, as a result of a change in Afghanistan’s government, at this time, no Canadian raised funds (either from private donations or from government) can be programmed there due to Canadian Criminal Code restrictions. As concerned Canadians, you can call your federal Member of Parliament and express your concern and frustration that legal barriers make it impossible for Canadian charities, like WVC, to support work in Afghanistan. Raise your concerns about the significant level of needs and the urgency to remove these barriers so that life-saving work can resume.</p>',
