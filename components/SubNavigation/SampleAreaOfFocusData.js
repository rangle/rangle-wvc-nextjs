With conflict, climate change and the enduring economic\nimpacts of COVID-19, families are struggling to access enough safe, nutritious food for basic human health\nand development. </p>\n<p> In 2021, 41 million4 people—approximately half of them girls and boys—were at risk of starvation in 43 countries, with 584,000 people enduring famine-like conditions in Ethiopia, Madagascar, South Sudan and Yemen. This\nis a crisis that often goes unnoticed, because much of the worsening hunger is concentrated in the world’s\nhardest to reach, most dangerous places where humanitarian access is difficult.</p>\n<p>We know from past emergencies, such as the 2011 Somalia famine in which 258,000 people are estimated\nto have died, that approximately half had already perished by the time a declaration of famine was made,\nand that half of all those who died were children younger than five years old. </p>\n<p>The vulnerability of agriculture to natural hazards and disasters is a major driver of hunger and food\ninsecurity. Between 2008 and 2018, approximately $108.5 billion US was lost because of declines in crop and\nlivestock production in both least developed and lower- and middle-income countries following disasters.\nOver that period, Asia was the hardest hit region, followed by Africa, then Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>\n<p>Women continue to be the face of food insecurity, with moderate or severe food insecurity being 10%\nhigher among women than men in 2020, a 4% increase from 2019. With high levels of income inequality and\nfood costs, consuming a healthy diet was out of reach for approximately 3 billion people in 2019, particularly\nthe poor. That number is now expected to have increased—according to FAO’s Food Price Index,\n global\nfood prices were 31.4% higher in October 2021 compared to October 2020.</p>\n<p>Large-scale food and nutrition crises can and should be a thing of the past—to make this a reality, we need\nstrong collective leadership, political will and the right financing, with short-term emergency responses and\nlonger-term commitments that address the underlying issues driving hunger. These efforts must all support\nhuman rights, peaceful resolutions to conflict and the transformation of food systems to become inclusive,\nsustainable and more resilient.</p>',

The pandemic’s severe outbreaks and increasingly transmissible\nvirus strains is hurting economic growth, especially in low-income countries where vaccine access remains\nlow. In sub-Saharan Africa, per capita income growth is forecast to remain subdued, averaging 0.4% a year\nin 2021 and 2022, following a 5% decline in 2020. Meanwhile, income inequality continues to increase,\nworsened by COVID-19.\n</p><p>Financial services are a tool that can help people rise out of poverty, providing access to credit and savings,\nthe ability to invest in education or businesses, and safety nets to weather financial emergencies. However,\nmany living in poverty lack services like bank accounts that can help in these ways. As of 2017, 1.7 billion adults\nwere “unbanked” around the world, most of them from developing economies. Women are over-represented,\naccounting for 56% of all unbanked adults, and 30% are young adults with lower education levels.\n</p><p>Education is an important factor in future economic success, yet there were 267 million young people\nnot involved in employment, education or training even before the pandemic, with young women\nthree times more likely than their male counterparts to be unemployed or out of school. In 2020, UNESCO\nestimated that 24 million children and youth were at risk of dropping out of school for financial reasons\nbecause of the pandemic.</p>',

Malnutrition contributes to an estimated 45% of child deaths worldwide—in 2019, that was\n2.3 million girls and boys under age five. For children who survive, the long-term effects are significant: by\nage three, 80% of a child’s brain is formed—during this critical period, good health, nutrition and nurturing\ncare are all foundational for children’s development, future learning and abilities to achieve their potential. </p>\nSo it’s sobering that an estimated 149 million young children in lower- and middle-income countries are\nstill chronically malnourished—known as “stunted”—a condition that restricts both physical growth and\nbrain development, especially in the first 1,000 days of life. A staggering 45 million young children also\nsuffer from wasting malnutrition with low weight for their height; this failure to gain weight often results\nfrom insufficient quantity and quality of food or infections that cause weight loss, and those with the\nmost severe cases of wasting are nine times more likely to die. With the combined economic and health\nsystem impacts of COVID-19, an additional 6.7 million children are now estimated to suffer from wasting\nmalnutrition, with South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa bearing the bulk of the burden.</p>\n<p>Stunting and wasting are not the only threats to girls and boys’ good nutrition. Even before the pandemic,\ntwo out of five children suffered from anemia in lower- and middle-income countries, making them\nvulnerable to infections and inhibiting their ability to learn. Iron deficiency anemia affects almost a third\nof girls and women of reproductive age, a condition that saps the energy they need to live full and\nproductive lives and hinders their capacity for learning. A recent review of data collected by the World\nHealth Organization (WHO) from 29 countries across five regions suggests that during pregnancy, severe\nanemia doubles the risk of women dying during and after childbirth.</p>',

The number of out-of-school girls—which is historically larger—\nhas been moving toward parity with boys, while the gender gap among primary-age children has decreased.\n</p><p>Despite these encouraging trends, access to quality learning remains a challenge for the world’s most vulnerable\nchildren, especially those living in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. In 2019, 127 million primary and secondary\nschool-age children and youth—nearly half of the world’s out-of-school population—were living in crisis-affected\ncountries, yet education received just 2.6% of total humanitarian funding, far below the target of 4% set by the\nUnited Nations in 2012.\n</p><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic heightening existing barriers to education, UNESCO now estimates that an\nadditional 11 million primary and secondary school-age children and youth may not return to school. Even\nso, gaps in education spending are widespread, and the pandemic continues to place downward pressure on\nfunding for development assistance around the world, including for education</p>',

        '<p>School shutdowns related to COVID-19 have been especially challenging for girls. Without the protective environment of school, they’ve become more exposed to gender-based violence, forced marriage and early pregnancy. The situation is particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa, where World Vision estimates that over one million girls are in danger of never returning to school. The loss of education will have far-reaching effects—not just on girls, but on their children and entire communities. If young mothers in these countries aren’t supported to continue their education, the region could see its economy suffer a loss of $10 billion US in GDP above and beyond the immediate effects of COVID-19.</p<p> Beyond basic access to quality education, effective learning remains a challenge. Even before the pandemic, six out of ten children and adolescents worldwide—an estimated 617 million young people— were not achieving minimum skill levels in reading and math. Despite years of growing school enrolment rates in sub-Saharan Africa, more than 70 million girls—or 90%—were not on track to meet minimum literacy standards by the time they were of age to complete primary education.</p>',

The economic return\non investment in ECCE programs is equal to roughly ten times their cost through projects focused on\nchildren’s early foundational learning and brain development.\n</p><p>Another concerning effect of COVID-19 is the worsened mental health of children and youth—a result\nof school shutdowns, lack of access to alternative learning options and in many cases, real loss and grief.\nWorldwide, more than 1.6 billion children have suffered some degree of lost education. The disruption\nto routines, learning, social interaction and recreation has left young people anxious, angry and worried\nabout their futures. Girls and boys report increased mental health problems—with girls reporting them\nmore—and LGBTQI+ learners cite some of the highest levels of isolation and anxiety.\n</p><p>Access to and completion of quality education is key for children’s future stability and success, and\nwith so much at stake for a generation of learners, the protective aspects provided through safe school\nenvironments, positive peer relationships and caring adults is critical to restore. </p>',

The majority of our investments (65%) were deployed in the most fragile countries—no projects with a primary WASH focus\nwere implemented in high developing countries. Unique among our sector portfolios, WASH programming in 2021 had a general balance\nbetween development programming (56%) and emergency response and protracted emergencies and fragile contexts (44% combined). This\nreveals the two main avenues of our WASH work: rapid support—especially with training and hygiene resources—to address survival needs in\nurgent or unstable settings, and the strengthening of infrastructure and systems in more stable contexts.',

        'In the past two decades, substantial progress has been made to provide the world’s population with\nbetter water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH). Even so, Sustainable Development Goal 6 set out to\nprovide water and sanitation access for all by 2030 and to leave no one behind, yet at least 2 billion people\nare still drinking water contaminated with feces and living without basic sanitation facilities like toilets and\nlatrines—and 673 million people still resort to defecating in the open.',

        '<p>The implications are significant, with more than 800 girls and boys under age five dying every day from\ndiarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.\n</p><p>Even as progress is made, we see deep inequalities related to water and sanitation on regional and national\nlevels. For example, 3% of the global population (207 million people) currently travel more than 30 minutes\nto collect water—two thirds of them live in sub-Saharan Africa, with the burden falling disproportionately on\nwomen. Imbalances within countries are also common: between 2000 and 2017, basic water coverage in rural\nHaiti increased among the richest but decreased among the poorest, widening the gap between them.\n</p><p>Disparities like these are compounded by growing challenges like climate change, political instability,\neconomic crises, and the yet unknown long-term impacts of COVID-19.\n</p><p>In reporting on the state of water, sanitation and hygiene in school settings across the world, UNICEF\nrevealed that nearly one in three schools lack basic drinking water services, affecting almost 600 million\nchildren; over a third of schools lack basic sanitation services, affecting nearly 700 million children; and in\nthe least developed countries, 49% of all schools have no handwashing facilities at all. Poor sanitation\nplays a particular role for women and girls. According to the World Bank, at least 500 million women and\ngirls are lacking a safe, clean, private facility to manage their menstrual hygiene, and this affects girls’\neducation—a meta-analysis by the World Bank found that a quarter of adolescent girls in India did not\nattend school during menstruation because of inadequate toilets.\n</p><p>Investing in WASH services has broad benefits to society. Sanitation deficits cost the global economy\nnearly $223 billion in 2015; however, a WHO study calculated a global return of $5.50 US for every dollar\nspent in sanitation—seen in lower health costs, more productivity and fewer premature deaths.\n</p><p>Achieving universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene would bring remarkable change, with global\nreductions in waterborne disease, better nutrition outcomes, hundreds of daily deaths prevented—and\nthe reality of a world that upholds the dignity, safety and future prospects of an entire generation. </p>',

One in every three women will be beaten, coerced into sex or otherwise abused in her lifetime. Little boys may come of age, seeing this happening to their mothers and sisters. The cycle can easily perpetuate. In its extreme form, gender-based violence manifests through crimes such as rape and honor killing, and brutal cultural practices such as female genital mutilation and early marriage. In cases where girl and women are harmed or killed, an entire family can be drastically impacted by the event.\n\n</p><p>But gender-based violence also manifests in subtler and even more pervasive ways, such as the restriction of actions and opinions, and control over choices and resources. When a girl is kept away from school, there may be little to challenge these approaches, and almost nowhere to turn for help in a crisis.</p>',

Many governments have made commitments to ensure participation and have guidelines meant to guide the involvement of all stakeholders in the process. Citizen participation is critical to ensure that policies are designed and delivered in a way that enables people to receive the right services critical to their needs in a way in which they can access.

Droughts that used to happen once every 10-20 years are now happening every two or three years. Severe storms, extreme heat events or prolonged dry spells can wipe out entire crops. This leaves families unable to provide enough nutritious food for their children and without an income.\n\n</p><p> Climate change is also causing an increase in natural disasters and very extreme weather. The poor are the most vulnerable – and least able to recover. Natural disasters like typhoons can take a terrible toll on lives, destroying property and forcing families to abandon their hom es and fields.\n\n</p><p>Climate change can make clean water even harder to find. Sources of fresh, clean water are drying up. This can leave children and families with no choice but to drink dirty water, putting them at risk of water-borne disease. It can force them to walk even longer distances, to find water to drink, cook with, wash with or i rrigate their plants. \n\n</p><p>Lastly, climate change can increase the risk of disease. Increasing temperatures make tropical diseases welcome in new areas, places where the population is less immune or prepared.

        '<p>World Vision recognizes the link between climate change and sustainable development. We work with communities to restore environments that have been harmed, protect healthy environments and systematically build good environments to make them progressively stronger and healthier.\n\n</p><p>Some of our projects include environmentally restorative activities such as reforestation, agro-forestry and organic and conservation farming. We aim to help communities that rely on farming for food and income to learn improved and environmentally sustainable farming techniques.\n\n</p><p>Here are a few examples: \n</p><ul><li>We have seen great success in reforesting in parts of Africa using the technique of Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, re-growing trees from root stumps of indigenous trees that were cut down in the past.\n</li><li>Several communities in Ethiopia have benefited from a cleaner, safer way to cook their food as a part of a clean stoves project. As well as reducing the health impacts associated with smoky, open fire stoves, the clean stoves can help reduce the number of trees cut down for firewood.\n</li><li>We also work with communities to improve their resilience, including disaster preparedness and risk reduction education, and improving food and water security.</li>',

      challenges_subsector_4_body:
        '<p>The effects of climate change are expected to become greater over time without urgent action at a global, national and local level.  \n\n</p><p>People living in the poorest countries contributed little to these problems but are disproportionately affected by their negative consequences. Among them, children, women and people with disabilities are the most vulnerable and the least equipped to adapt to a changing climate.\n\n</p><p>Working to halt climate change can be expensive, and inconvenient. But, the impact of doing nothing would be devastating for all of us. It’s already devastating for millions of the world’s poorest children. \n\n</p><p>World bodies, governments, corporations and individuals must do whatever we can to protect children and families around the world from ever-worsening outcomes of climate change.</p>',
